    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage!</h1>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>
      This is my first attempt at creating a complete HTML webpage. I'm learning
      how to structure content properly with different heading levels,
      paragraphs, and even clickable images!
    </p>

    <h2>Why I'm Learning Web Development</h2>
    <p>
      Web development is an essential skill in today's digital world. By
      learning HTML, I'm taking my first steps toward becoming a full-stack
      developer. The ALX program is helping me gain these valuable skills.
    </p>

    <h3>My Current Focus</h3>
    <p>
      Right now, I'm focusing on mastering the basics of HTML. This includes
      understanding how to properly structure a webpage with semantic elements
      and create meaningful content hierarchies.
    </p>

    <h3>Future Goals</h3>
    <p>
      After mastering HTML, I plan to move on to CSS to make my webpages
      visually appealing, and then JavaScript to add interactivity. Eventually,
      I want to build complete web applications!
